## Features

* Upload two images (JPG, JPEG, PNG).
* Displays uploaded images.
* Calculates and displays overall sharpness scores for each image.
* Calculates and displays overall noise level estimates for each image.
* Highlights the N sharpest region(s) in each image with a red rectangle on a grayscale version.
* Provides a comparative summary of which image is "better" based on these metrics.
* Built with Python, Streamlit, OpenCV, and Pillow.
